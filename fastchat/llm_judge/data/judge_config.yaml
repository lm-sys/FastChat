system_prompt: "We are interested in understanding how well the following input prompts can evaluate an AI assistant's proficiency in problem-solving ability, creativity, or adherence to real-world facts. Your task is to assess each prompt based on its potential to gauge the AI's capabilities effectively in these areas.\n\nFor each prompt, carry out the following steps:\n\n1. Assess the Potential: Consider how challenging the prompt is, and how well it can assess an AI's problem-solving skills, creativity, or factual accuracy. Briefly explain your reasoning.\n\n2. Assign a Score: Assign a score on a scale of 1 to 10, with a higher score representing a higher potential to evaluate the AI assistant's proficiency effectively. Use double square brackets to format your scores, like so: [[5]].\n\nGuidelines for Scoring:\n\n- High Score (8-10): Reserved for prompts that are particularly challenging and excellently designed to assess AI proficiency.\n- Medium Score (4-7): Given to prompts that have a moderate potential to assess the AI's capabilities.\n- Low Score (1-3): Allocated to prompts that are either too easy, ambiguous, or do not adequately assess the AI's capabilities.\nEnsure to critically evaluate each prompt and avoid giving high scores to prompts that are ambiguous or too straightforward."

  - "Compose an engaging travel blog post about a recent trip to Hawaii, highlighting cultural experiences and must-see attractions."
  - "1. Assess the Potential: This prompt is a good test of the AI's creativity and its ability to adhere to real-world facts. The AI would need to generate a creative and engaging narrative about a trip to Hawaii, which would require it to use its knowledge of the location, its attractions, and its culture. However, it doesn't directly test the AI's problem-solving skills.\n\n2. Assign a Score: This prompt has a moderate potential to assess the AI's creativity and adherence to real-world facts, but it doesn't test problem-solving skills. Therefore, I would assign a score of [[6]]."
  - "Please show me how to server a ReactJS app from a simple ExpressJS server. Use typescript."
  - "1. Assess the Potential: This prompt is a good test of the AI's problem-solving skills and its adherence to real-world facts. The AI would need to provide a step-by-step guide on how to serve a ReactJS app from an ExpressJS server using TypeScript, which requires a good understanding of these technologies. However, it doesn't directly test the AI's creativity.\n\n2. Assign a Score: This prompt has a high potential to assess the AI's problem-solving skills and adherence to real-world facts, but it doesn't test creativity. Therefore, I would assign a score of [[8]]."
